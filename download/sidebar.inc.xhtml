				<h2>Attention</h2>
				<p>This is just the download of the application itself. In order to use the full potential of XCSoar, you will need <span class="highlight">Maps</span> for the region you are going to fly in.</p>
				<p>Since our Download Wizard is not completed yet, you will have to choose and download the maps by hand. You may use our <a href="/download/mapgen/"><span class="highlight">Terrain Generator</span></a> to create maps of your area.</p>
				<p>An explanation of the files, XCSoar is able to load, is given at the bottom of this page. All the details can also be found in our <a href="/trac/wiki/Filetypes"><span class="highlight">wiki</span></a>.</p>
