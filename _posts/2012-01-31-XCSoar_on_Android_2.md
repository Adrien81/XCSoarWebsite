We're proud to announce that by now over 9.400 people have downloaded and
installed XCSoar on their Android devices!

That number counts only the installs via the
[Google Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.xcsoar) though.
Since we don't track our users we have no idea how many people still use
XCSoar on Windows Mobile or other platforms.

XCSoar 6.3 is coming soon! The first alpha version will be released in the
next weeks...
