## User list

[XCSoar Users](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xcsoar-user) is the place for discussion of the current versions of XCSoar.  
How to install and use it, tips and observations. Traffic is generally low-volume, but a digest is available.

## Developer list

[XCSoar Development](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xcsoar-devel) is the place for discussion on how to improve XCSoar.  
As any discussion here will be of features not yet implemented in XCSoar, there is no reason (other than curiosity) for most end-users to subscribe.
